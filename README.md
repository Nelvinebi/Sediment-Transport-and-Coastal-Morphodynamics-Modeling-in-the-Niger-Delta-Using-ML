# Sediment Transport and Coastal Morphodynamics Modeling in the Niger Delta Using Machine Learning

A data-driven coastal modeling project that investigates sediment transport dynamics and shoreline morphodynamics in the Niger Delta using machine learning and synthetic oceanographic data.

The project simulates realistic coastal conditions, predicts sediment transport rates, and analyzes morphodynamic behavior such as erosion and accretion processes, supporting coastal environmental analysis and spatial decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

The Niger Delta coastline is highly dynamic, with sediment movement controlled by interactions between waves, tidal processes, ocean currents, and sediment characteristics. These processes influence shoreline stability, ecosystem health, and coastal infrastructure.

This project applies machine learning techniques to simulate and model sediment transport behavior using physically consistent synthetic coastal datasets.

By integrating multiple oceanographic and sediment variables, the workflow predicts sediment transport rates and morphodynamic responses, demonstrating how data science and environmental modeling can support coastal research and management.

🎯 Project Objectives

The main goals of this project include:

• Simulating realistic coastal and oceanographic forcing conditions for the Niger Delta
• Predicting sediment transport rates using machine learning
• Analyzing coastal morphodynamic responses including erosion and accretion patterns
• Identifying key environmental drivers influencing sediment transport
• Generating analytical visualizations that explain coastal sediment dynamics

🌊 Coastal Factors Considered

The model evaluates several environmental variables that influence sediment movement.

Feature	Description
Wave Height (m)	Represents wave energy impacting sediment transport
Wave Period (s)	Controls wave-induced sediment motion
Current Velocity (m/s)	Drives horizontal sediment displacement
Tidal Range (m)	Influences sediment redistribution through tidal fluctuations
Sediment Grain Size (mm)	Determines sediment mobility
Sediment Density (kg/m³)	Influences settling behavior of particles
Beach Slope (degrees)	Affects coastal erosion potential
Shoreline Orientation (degrees)	Determines exposure to wave energy
🧮 Methodology

The project follows a simplified coastal morphodynamic modeling workflow.

1️⃣ Synthetic Coastal Data Generation

A synthetic dataset was generated representing realistic ranges of hydrodynamic and sediment characteristics typical of the Niger Delta coastal environment.

The dataset includes multiple environmental variables influencing sediment transport.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

The dataset is prepared using:

• Feature scaling with Min–Max normalization
• Validation of variable ranges and data structure
• Preparation of predictor variables for machine learning modeling

3️⃣ Machine Learning Modeling

A Random Forest regression model is applied to predict sediment transport rates based on environmental forcing variables.

Random Forest is used because it:

• Handles nonlinear environmental relationships
• Captures interactions between coastal variables
• Provides interpretable feature importance analysis

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using:

• Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
• Coefficient of Determination (R²)

These metrics help evaluate how accurately the model predicts sediment transport rates.

📊 Data Visualizations

Several visualizations are generated to analyze sediment transport behavior and interpret model results.

1️⃣ 3D Morphodynamic Response Surface

This three-dimensional surface plot illustrates how key coastal forcing variables interact to influence sediment transport dynamics.
